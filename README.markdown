# HOW TO USE: 
Use these code examples as a guideline for formatting your HTML email.  You may want to create your own template based on these snippets or just pick and choose the ones that fix your specific rendering issue(s).  Remember, some header styles can be converted inline using your email service provider's toolset; or you can use many of the ones found on the web. DO NOT COPY OVER COMMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE CODE to your message or risk spam box banishment :).

## A few things to note:    

1. Not all of the styles in the header area should be brought inline. Those instances will be marked accordingly in the comments.
2. Remember to test accordingly with your own code and styling. Although this code will help you get through a number of HTML email issues, it is no substitute for proper testing.
